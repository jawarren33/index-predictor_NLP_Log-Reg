# index-predictor_NLP_Log-Reg
This repo contains a project where I use sentiment analysis models and various regression models to predict daily stock index movement. The independent variable data is captured using web-scraping techniques on a site called StockTwits, a real-time "Twitter-like" forum that can be tagged with ticker symbols.
